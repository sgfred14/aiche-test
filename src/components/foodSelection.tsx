<div>The flagship event of AIChE-VIT, Chem-A-Thon, aims to inspire and challenge undergraduates from all across Asia. Students are persuaded to look beyond theory as they form practical solutions for real-world crises during this 36-hour hackathon. Our event promotes cooperation, technical ingenuity, and meaningful dialogue among students, researchers, and industry leaders through faculty-led checkpoints, resource support, and an emphasis on innovation.

<div className="mb-12">Collaborating with VIT's School of Chemical Engineering (SCHEME), we hosted Chem-A-Thon 6.0 from February 14–16, 2025. Contestants were grouped by their academic years and provided challenge statements related to Environmental Sustainability, Product Development, and Design & Simulation. Teams were led through several checkpoints and worked diligently while adhering to safety procedures to produce ideas that had an impact. Supported by sponsors and industry experts, the event integrated creativity, teamwork, and realistic problem-solving—conveying its mission to shape the next generation of chemical engineers.
